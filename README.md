# DrawsyDetector
#### This is a program that was written using python. I used the following libraries to implement this program.
    - üí† openCV
    - üßä numpy
    - ‚öôÔ∏è dlib
    - üîâ vlc
    
### The goal of the project
##### The goal of this project was to create a prototype of a program that can be built on so that It can help in avoiding drowsy driving and potentially save lives by preventing car accients during long drives.


### How it works?
#### The above modules used in this program explain how this program was implemented. 
- OpenCV is used to access real time video feed form the device that the program is running on 
- numpy is used to handle the array based calculations such as the Eucleadian distance to calculate the distance between two points. 
- The points in our case are landmarks of differnt points on our face that the dlib module provides.
